            <h1>CANA</h1>
            <h2>Own Reality</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction: From Conversation to Revolution</h3>
            <p>CANA ($CANA) is more than a coin, a brand, or a product line—it's a cultural shift born from a simple conversation about wellness, identity, and the canna lifestyle.</p>
            <p>From these early talks, a movement emerged—one rooted in authenticity, sustainability, and creative ownership. In an era where blockchain often feels distant from real life, CANA bridges the gap. We connect real-world products with on-chain proof, making ownership smarter, more meaningful, and deeply personal.</p>
            <p>We're reimagining what it means to own.</p>
            <p>With Real-World Asset (RWA)-Backed NFTs, CANA enables users to own digital tokens that are intrinsically tied to physical items—each item is traceable, verifiable, and one-of-a-kind.</p>
            
            <h3>Vision: Own the Culture. Shape the Future.</h3>
            <p>Ownership should go beyond possession—it should be proof, participation, and potential.</p>
            <p>Imagine a world where your hoodie is a verified asset, your sneakers have an identity you can scan, every item you own exists both in real life and the metaverse, and reselling doesn't just transfer a product, it transfers an entire history.</p>
            <p>CANA is turning that vision into a tangible, blockchain-powered reality. Welcome to the era of smart, circular ownership.</p>
            
            <h3>The Story: From Waste to Worth, One of One</h3>
            <p>Once your destruction video is verified, the NFT is cleared for resale. The new buyer, upon purchase, receives a brand-new physical product, tied to that same NFT identity—reborn, but never duplicated.</p>
            <p>This isn't just resale—it's ritual. Responsibility. Rarity.</p>
            <p>And yes—you, the original owner, receive 50% of the resale value automatically. The other 50% goes to CANA as a resale royalty, which funds the reproduction of the new physical item.</p>
            <p>That's ownership redefined—from waste to worth.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Components</h3>
            <h4>RWA-Backed NFT Collection</h4>
            <p>Every CANA NFT represents a real physical product: streetwear & apparel, lifestyle gear, and limited-edition collectibles. When you mint, you get a digital NFT stored in your wallet and receive a physical product delivered to you. Both are tied via a unique QR code, registered on-chain.</p>
            
            <h4>Proof of Ownership via QR Code</h4>
            <p>Each item is embedded with a QR code that links to the NFT's blockchain record, confirms product authenticity and ownership history, enables resale with royalty triggers, and protects uniqueness in secondary markets. This system prevents counterfeits, empowers resale, and keeps value alive across owners.</p>
            
            <h4>One-of-One Protocol: Destruction Before Resale</h4>
            <p>We don't believe in mass replication. We believe in uniqueness. Before reselling any CANA NFT, the original physical product must be destroyed—a video recording is required as proof. This ensures no two people ever own the same physical item, the rarity and integrity of the NFT remain intact, and the incoming buyer receives a newly manufactured version of the same one-of-one item. It's more than resale—it's legacy transfer.</p>
            
            <h4>Cross-Reality Integration</h4>
            <p>Own it in real life. Wear it in digital worlds. Link your hoodie to a video game, equip your avatar with your physical sneakers, and mirror your offline identity in the metaverse. We're integrating with gaming and virtual platforms to bring your style across realities.</p>
            
            <h4>Community-First Utility & Benefits</h4>
            <p>At CANA, ownership = membership. Holding a verified CANA NFT unlocks early access to new collections, time-based perks for long-term holders, in-game boosts & power-ups, 50% resale payout to sellers when your item is resold via our marketplace, 50% royalty goes to CANA to fund reproduction of new items for future buyers, and exclusive airdrops, merch, and events. We're not just building a platform. We're building a tribe.</p>
            
            <h3>Mainnet & Infrastructure Strategy</h3>
            <p>CANA is currently trading as a meme coin on the TON blockchain, harnessing viral culture to spark early traction. We're launching a custom CANA Layer-2 on TON, tailored for seamless NFT creation & management, ownership verification via QR tools, product resale & royalty distribution, and DAO-powered governance and staking. Built for speed, simplicity, and scalability.</p>
            
            <h3>Multi-Chain NFT Deployment</h3>
            <p>To maximize accessibility and liquidity, CANA is going multi-chain. Already live on Polygon, Sui, and Apechain. Next targets include Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Aptos, Base, Fantom, Abstract, and TON (native Layer-2). Cross-chain means more users, more markets, and consistent, secure ownership everywhere.</p>
            
            <h3>Marketplace & Resale Engine</h3>
            <p>We're developing a dedicated RWA NFT marketplace that offers verified secondhand resale, 50% payout to the original seller once they verify product destruction, 50% royalty to CANA used to reproduce a fresh one-of-one physical product for the next buyer, QR code-based authenticity tools, and multi-chain compatibility. This is not just a store—it's a Web3 resale engine, built for circular value and sustainable product regeneration.</p>
            
            <h3>The Future of CANA</h3>
            <p>Gaming & Metaverse Integration: Equip avatars with CANA-linked fashion, earn perks for in-game wearables, and showcase your NFT identity in digital realms.</p>
            <p>Community Governance (DAO): Vote on drop designs, propose new utilities, and guide partnerships and treasury use. We believe in decentralized creative power.</p>
            <p>Web3 Education Portal: To help onboard the next wave of users, we'll launch a learn-to-earn portal featuring blockchain basics, NFT ownership & RWA guides, and Web3 integration courses. Knowledge is value. Access is freedom.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion: Redefining Ownership</h3>
            <p>CANA is setting a new standard. It's not just about products. It's about proving ownership, creating value over time, building a culture of digital and physical connection, and rewarding users with real-world returns.</p>
            <p>Every product is one-of-one. Every transaction is a story. Every scan is a truth.</p>
            <p>Mint. Scan. Burn. Resell. Earn. Repeat.</p>
            <p class="final">Welcome to CANA. Own Reality.</p>
